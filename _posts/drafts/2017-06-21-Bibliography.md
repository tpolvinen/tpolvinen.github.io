You can find my current bibliography in my Github repository, [here](https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri/blob/master/bib/agri.bib).
The file itself is in BetterBibLaTex format and with file extension .bib.

I know it's not easily readable or anything fancy, but so far I haven't come across a way to get bibliography file automatically updated and published in this blog when I make updates to my Zotero collection. Manually updating it will just not work with me. Sorry.

Please let me know in the comments or email me `tatu dot polvinen at gmail.com` if you know any way to make it happen. :)
