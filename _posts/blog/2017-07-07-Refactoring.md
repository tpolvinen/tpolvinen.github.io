I have –finally– refactored my previous research plan and research report and used them to compose a file for my actual thesis. Yay! Only to make clear to me that how much work is still needed to be done. Not so much yay. Nay, actually.

The `oppari.md` file in my Github repository `Agri` is located along other mentioned files in `source` folder, [here](https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri/tree/master/source).

Too tired to write anything else right now. Good night.
