I felt unsure about my skills and plans for interviews so I decided to have a look at the literature on conducting research interviews.
While googling around wasn't very successful this time I asked some (vastly) more experienced people for some hints. With a couple of recommendations I went and searched our campus library both with Finna search engine and old-school shelf browsing, with good results.

**J. Gubrium & J. Holstein. Handbook of Interview Research: Context and Method** [Google Books](https://books.google.fi/books/about/Handbook_of_Interview_Research.html?id=uQMUMQJZU4gC&redir_esc=y)

**S. Hirsjärvi & H. Hurme. Tutkimushaastattelu: teemahaastattelun teoria ja käytäntö** [Google Books](https://books.google.fi/books?id=tVhsOwAACAAJ&dq=tutkimushaastattelu+hirsjärvi&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4ptyNyMrUAhUmApoKHY7cC3MQ6AEIJjAA)

**S. Hirsjärvi. Tutki ja kirjoita** [Google Books](https://books.google.fi/books?id=lqK8QwAACAAJ&dq=tutki+ja+kirjoita+hirsjärvi&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiav7bQyMrUAhXtbZoKHf-vCHUQ6AEIJjAA)

**P. Alasuutari. Laadullinen tutkimus 2.0** [Vastapaino](http://vastapaino.fi/kirjat/laadullinen-tutkimus-2-0/)

While I have a rather short time in hand to go through all of that, by reading though the most relevant -I think- parts of Handbook of Interview Research I managed to get get some additional insights and many confirmations that the way I've been collecting contacts and how I've been planning the interviews has been quite all right. I believe that I'll get some additional insights in a next couple of days while the rest of the material.
