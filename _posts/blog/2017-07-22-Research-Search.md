A recent news article in [Helsingin sanomat](hs.fi) piqued my interest: in the deepest mine in Europe at Pyhäjärvi, [Luonnonvarakeskus (Luke)](https://www.luke.fi) is running a research project on how plants like potatoes and nettle could be grown deep underground. In this case, almost 700 meters underground. Here's the article in Finnish: [Euroopan syvin kaivos...](http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000005280437.html) and the project's page on Luke's website: [Älykästä tutkimusta ja koetuotantoa](https://www.luke.fi/projektit/alykasta-tutkimusta-ja-koetuotantoa/). I've got in touch with Luke and sent initial emails to researchers working on this project, but as most of the people are on their summer vacations I've yet to hear back from them. I'll get back on this a bit later in my future posts.

In the meanwhile, I've been looking for more research papers, researchers and articles to rebuild a better version of my literature survey. After looking into --just a glance, really-- professor [Salah Sukkarieh's](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/salah.sukkarieh.php) work on [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au)'s pages I  I got a hunch that it might be a good idea to further look into what I could find by searching for organizations first rather than research. So, instead of the usual *google + google scholar + keywords* combination I've looked into different organizations like universities and unions, people working in those organizations, their publications and events.

But before going into that, I'd like to update you on how and what I've found recently:
Via Sukkarieh's articles I found [Journal of Field Robotics](http://www.journalfieldrobotics.org/Home.html) and [International Society for Horticultural Science](http://www.ishs.org), "The world's leading independent organization of horticultural scientists". ISHS has many [publications](http://www.ishs.org/publications), especially [Acta Horticulturae](http://www.ishs.org/acta-horticulturae) where I've found several articles I would like to read, but unfortunately it's not available in my school library and I'm not sure if paying for membership would be profitable enough. Same with the Journal of Field Robotics. So far I've marked the articles I've found most interesting and will return to them if needed. If so, I'll see if I can get university library to get an access. It appears that the first issue of the current year of the Journal of Field Robotics is freely available [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.2017.34.issue-1/issuetoc), but I didn't find any articles there that would be relevant to my work.

While browsing some promising articles, I came across [Field and Service Robotics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-07488-7), *Results of the 9th International Conference* which again appeared very promising, but you guessed it, I can't get access to since neither my school *Haaga-Helia*, [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) nor [Aalto university](http://www.aalto.fi/en/) can be found in the organizations list of the Shibboleth / Open Athens login page, at least for this journal.

Also, Elsevier's journal [Computers and Electronics in Agriculture](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-electronics-in-agriculture/) that I found via *Acta Horticulturae* is just as well behind a paywall. I hope I can find a way in, but I'm feeling a bit sads. I'm going home.

Which means, to Finnish universities like *University of Helsinki* and *Aalto university*. This was encouraged by finding [Timo Oksanen's](http://autsys.aalto.fi/en/TimoOksanen) [Robottikylvön ja -kylvömuokkauksen mahdollisuudet ja haasteet Suomessa (PDF)](http://www.smts.fi/MTP_julkaisu_2014/Esitykset/Oksanen_Linkolehto_Robottikylvon_ja-kylvomuokkauksen_mahdollisuudet_ja_haasteet_Suomessa.pdf) via [The Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland](http://www.smts.fi/en)'s bi annual conference [Maataloustieteen päivät](http://www.smts.fi/fi/tapahtumat), which was a find on it's own. But since I forgot which way I found it, I've also started to keep track of which way I came across it in my notebook (pen and paper --shocking, I know), in addition of keeping track of what I find and where in my [Evernote](https://evernote.com). Finally, sources making it to my work get added to my [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) database. When I feel like I've got something to "write home about" I write about it in this blog to clear the image a little bit. Then, I'll get around to actual writing. I think-feel this system could be improved upon a lot but right now it serves me well enough. Please comment or email me if you have any advice!

Another case in point, I've got no clue how I came across [Tyynelän tila](http://tyynelantila.fi), but their pages, both web and [FB](https://www.facebook.com/Tyynelantila) combined with Etelä-Saimaa's [article (PDF)](http://tyynelantila.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/15.5.2015-Etelä-Saimaan-uutisaukeama.pdf) and Kauppalehti's [article (PDF)](http://tyynelantila.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kauppalehti_13.08.2013_pienempi-tiedosto.pdf) convinced me that I'd better contact Juuso Joona, master of the farm and see if I could visit.

Anyhoo, now we're getting to that part about browsing organizations' pages:
Inspired by my finding *SMTS* and *Maataloustieteen päivät*, I've branched out from universities to see what else I could find. Looking into other Finnish agricultural organizations I've come across [Pro Agria](https://www.proagria.fi), [Luke](https://www.luke.fi) and [Finnish Environment Institute (Syke)](http://www.syke.fi/en-US) with some success: while I haven't found much from *Pro Agria* and *Syke*, going through *Luke*'s archive of news, publications and projects has yielded many notes, which equals stuff to read. Lots of stuff to read. The reason I haven't found much from *Syke*'s site is just that there's so much to go through that I'll need to do some search engine voodoo, and I haven't got around doing that just yet.

I actually found *Luke*'s [OPAL-Life project](http://www.opal.fi/en/) twice: first I was googling *MTT*'s *Ilmasopu* project, leading to *Luke*'s news article [Ilmastonmuutos tuo uusia viljelykasveja](https://portal.mtt.fi/portal/page/portal/mtt/mtt/ajankohtaista/Uutisarkisto/2009/Ilmastonmuutos%20tuo%20uusia%20viljelykasveja). Also, *MTT* has been a part of *Luke* since 2015, I found out. Since the link to *MTT*'s research programs was broken I hopefully went to *Luke*'s [Research Focus](https://www.luke.fi/en/research/) page, chose [Boreal Green Bioeconomy](https://www.luke.fi/en/research/boreal-green-bioeconomy/) programme, where among Key Projects was a link to *OPAL-Life*.

The second time around I was taking a break from writing this post, scrolling my FB feed. A friend had shared *YLE*'s news article referring to two of *Luke*'s projects, *ScenoProt* and [FutureCrops](https://www.luke.fi/futurecrops/fi/etusivu/)(in Finnish). Interesting! On that page there's a section *Projekti somessa* that has tweets about the project and there was also a tweet about drones published just this morning, [here](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/888297532178272256). I clicked on the link that took me to *Luke*'s [news article page](https://www.luke.fi/uutiset/pellon-ylla-lentava-drone-rekisteroi-monenlaista-tietoa/) (in Finnish) that mentions *OPAL-Life* project, which I had forgotten in just six days. I really need to review my *Evernote* and other notes before going much further...but there's that cool project [Tree seedling production under changing environment](https://www.luke.fi/en/projects/taimitaito/) that gave me an idea to google 'tree seedling plant factory' and finding that it's already a business, at least in greenhouses, like in [Itasca Greenhouse Inc.](http://www.itascagreenhouse.com/treeseedlings.html) in Minnesota. Hey I'd better read more about this...and I found more about it at *Luke*'s article [Forest tree seedlings...](https://www.luke.fi/en/mt-forest-tree-seedlings-can-cultivated-even-without-natural-light/). That adds one more researcher to my to-contact-list. :)

But back to *Luke*'s projects, theres also that [Digitalization in Bioeconomy -roadmap](https://www.luke.fi/en/projects/digibio/) which actually can be found at [VTT's site (PDF)](http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/visions/2017/V11.pdf)... that I just happened to find through *Luke*'s article [Digitaalinen ruokaketju...](https://www.luke.fi/mt-digitaalinen-ruokaketju-haukkaa-tietoa-ja-tulostaa-alykkaita-annoksia/). Browsing the list of projects, I finally found an article about [Cyberthreaths on Primary Production](https://www.luke.fi/uutiset/kyberturvallisuus-elintarkea-myos-maataloudessa/) (in Finnish), full paper available [here (PDF)](http://jukuri.luke.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/539088/luke-luobio_32_2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) (in Finnish as well). How awesome is that? Very awesome, I'd say.

There's also a couple of articles that I may cite in introduction that are about profitability of agricultural businesses and [climate change](https://www.luke.fi/mt-oletko-huomannut-ilmasto-muuttuu/). But more useful for my work may be the one about how [Urban Greenhouses Could Cut Down on Product's Carbon Footprint](https://www.luke.fi/uutiset/kaupunkikasvihuoneet-pienentaisivat-tuotteiden-hiilijalanjalkea/). That article also mentions [Voimakas project](http://voimakas.fi) that aims to improve the profitability of Finnish horticultural production. At a glance on *Voimakas* pages, there's an article about a report on [Utilization of microalgae in industrial symbiosis, focus on Finland](http://voimakas.fi/2017/06/16/levien-teollinen-ja-laajamittainen-viljely-suomessa-on-haastavaa/) (full report PDF available [here](http://voimakas.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/LopullinenLeväRaporttiluke-luobio_33_2017.pdf)). Also a post about L. Särkkä's thoughts on her visit to Dutch agricultural university, which I guess means [Wageningen University & Research](http://www.wur.nl/en.htm). She writes about a research project that studies plant production in space that will involve a 9-month simulation period in Antarctica, where people are attempting to full Martian, so to speak. "I'm going to science the shit out of this." Särkkä speculates that in future, ever more exotic plants could be grown in Finnish greenhouses. The business case for this could be that in northern climate it's not needed to use as much pesticides and that in turn could be used as an advantage. Now this is getting interesting...she mentions plants like vanilla, papaya, mango, hops and moringa. I'll see if I could find some of her research.

I've found so many interesting articles via *Maataloustieteen päivät* that I will probably write a separate post on my findings from there. This one is getting a bit long already. Also, I have to go through T. Oksanen's and S. Sukkarieh's works in a similar way. Perhaps I could actually contact Oksanen and ask for a chat? I'm a bit apprehensive but I think that I'll dare myself.

As I'm likely have found out by now the main organizational players on this field and familiarized myself with their pages, I'm moving on to Doria and Theseus search engines / databases to find out relevant theses. I've got some promising notes already, but I guess the results are better served with separate blog post. Also, [I'm writing this at three AM](https://youtu.be/QwwMRIYE46Y). 

Good night,

T


PS: I noticed that I had mentioned Elsevier Open Access on a note about *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture* journal. Turns out several of the said journals articles are freely available [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01681699/open-access?sdc=1). I just needed to click on *Open Access articles* to bring them up. Writing notes along and about your surfing-browsing is **useful**. No more sads. :D
