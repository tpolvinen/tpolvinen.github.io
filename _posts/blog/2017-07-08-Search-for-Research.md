Since the literature survey/theoretical in my research plan was rather minimal and not really where I wanted it to be I got back to work on searching more relevant and up-to-date research work and articles. Also, it's about 20 pages too short. `:P`

I met some new people at the MycoHacklab meetup #4 and I was told (among other things) about [Impact Iglu](http://impactiglu.org) that "*is an impact business accelerator that supports entrepreneurs to solve business and societal challenges together.*" From their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/impactiglu/) I found a link to [ii2030](http://www.ii2030.com) event [Precision Agriculture for Smallholder Farmers](http://www.ii2030.com/tracks/precision-agriculture/) in Berlin, Germany at Oct 18 - 19, 2017. I'd love to be there for the visits to *hydroponic farming project* and *satellite data provider*. Not to mention all the people that I could meet there! I wish I could attend, but I would need some serious sponsorship to get there. `$)`

From [Impact Iglu's page](http://impactiglu.org) I also found out about german [Green Alley Award](http://green-alley-award.com) that on 2016 won by [Green City Solution's](https://greencitysolutions.de/en/) [CityTree](https://greencitysolutions.de/en/solutions/) that's an IoT-enabled and -controlled green wall much like [Naava's](https://www.naava.io) product, but instead of plants it's growing moss that may be more effective solution.

However, I couldn't find anything about plant production -as in agriculture- from Green Alley Award's pages, nor at [ArcticStartup](http://arcticstartup.com) so I'll be concentrating on research papers and articles I've found from [International Society for Horticultural Science](http://www.ishs.org) publications on this weekend, leaving the world of start-ups for a more scholarly one. **I'll be back** in a couple of days.

Also, professor [Salah Sukkarieh's](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/salah.sukkarieh.php) extensive work appears more than promising. I found about it from [The World Economic Forum's](https://www.weforum.org) article [These are the top 10 emerging technologies of 2017](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/these-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2017/). Go knock yourself out.
