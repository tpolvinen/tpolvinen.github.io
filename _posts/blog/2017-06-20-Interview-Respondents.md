I'm on my third week already. Sheesh.

I haven't got pretty much anything written since the research plan was accepted, but I've been chasing respondents to interview. I guess-hope that it counts for something. Also, I really haven't searched for additional material for the lit survey -but I've got some interesting links to papers and projects on algae cultivation.

To bring you up to speed, here's what I've got done on these first three weeks:

As I told about my thesis plan to one ol' friend of mine, he mentioned that one of our equally old acquaintance is in the process of setting up a plant factory startup company, pretty much as a hobby to begin with. He turned out to be very supportive and we set up a meeting where among other things discussed I was told about [Helsieni](http://www.helsieni.fi) company and other urban farmers. I wondered whether mushroom cultivation would count as plant production but was impressed as I read more about them. Definately good stuff.
Luckily, Helsieni was one of the companies with a stand at Sustainable Business area of [World Village Festival](http://www.maailmakylassa.fi/english/home) 2017. I went, had a chat, some fried mushrooms and was invited to next [mycohacklab](http://mycohacklab.org) meet at Helsieni office. It turned out to be very nice, informal and frienly hobbyist meet and I got to know some nice people and to see how the cultivaton containers (actual repurposed shipping containers as plant factories) work.

From Helsieni's Facebook feed I read about [Open Source Circular Economy day](https://www.facebook.com/events/2299096813648177) at [Teurastamo](www.teurastamo.com) where I met urban gardener and one of the founders of [Little Garden](http://pikkupuutarha.fi). We got along nicely and after a couple of emails after the event set up a meeting at [Turntable](http://kaantopoyta.fi), which is Dodo´s urban farming centre at Helsinki, Pasila.

From Helsieni I also got to hear about [MTK](https://www.mtk.fi)'s [North Food seminar](https://startnorth.com/#/event/77) (also [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNV7kSAFjqLBi_fU74vj3fIH4aIP1m1pl_p6Hde4e3Gv9gtg/viewform?c=0&w=1)), where I met a couple of farmers interested in new ways of doing business, insect farmers from [Entocube](https://www.entocube.com), researchers from Helsinki and Aalto universities, organizers from [MTK Uusimaa](http://www.mtkuusimaa.fi) and many startup entrepreneurs working or intersted in food production.

On the second day of the event/seminar we got a tour of Helsinki university's Faculty Agriculture and Forestry, where I made contacts with researchers working with National Plant Phenotyping Infrastructure FIRI and doctoral students working on their theses, one on microalgae and other on plant monitoring using multispectral drone photoraphy. This is getting awesome.

From MTK's pages i read about [MTK 100 historiallinen työkonekavalkadi event](https://www.mtk.fi/mtk_100/tyokonekavalkadi/fi_FI/tyokonekavalkadi/) where I met with researchers from [Yara](http://www.yara.fi) and some very knowledgeable people working with [Valtra](http://www.valtra.fi).

I will keep in touch with these people and secure as many interviews as possible, probably during the next two months. Yeah, I can dream. :)
