I'm Tatu, a BIT / IT / software dev. student at Haaga Helia University of Applied Sciences / Haaga Helia Ammattikorkeakoulu. I came across the Agricultural IoT quite accidentally but since things looked interesting and I find food production rather important, I rustled up a research plan-ish thing and surprisingly it was accepted as a plan for my bachelor's thesis. You can find the plan alog workflow and all other files in my Github repository at: [https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri](https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri)

This blog is all about communicating the writing process of the said thesis. It -hopefully- will grow up to be an overview of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies applied on plant production. I will cover some of the most interesting and relevant research I've found and interviews of as diverse set of agents working on the field. Yes, some of them literally working on a field. :)
