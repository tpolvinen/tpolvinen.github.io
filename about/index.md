I'm Tatu, a BIT / IT / software dev. student at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. I came across the Agricultural applicatons of Internet of Things quite accidentally, but since things looked interesting and I find food production rather important, I rustled up a research plan-ish thing for a survey. It was accepted as a plan for my bachelor's thesis. Shocking, I know. 

In case I haven't covered everything in this blog or you would like to read the actual work-in-progress of my survey-thesis, you can find the plan along workflow description and all other files in my Github repository at: [https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri](https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri)

This blog is all about communicating the writing process of the said thesis. I will cover some of the most interesting and relevant research and applications I've found with interviews of as diverse set of respondents as I can get my hands on.
