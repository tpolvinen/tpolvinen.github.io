I'm Tatu, a BIT / IT / software dev. student at Haaga Helia University of Applied Sciences. I came across the Agricultural IoT quite accidentally but since things looked interesting and I find food production rather important, I rustled up a research plan-ish thing and surprisingly it was accepted as a plan for my bachelor's thesis. You can find the plan alog workflow and all other files in my Github repository at: [https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri](https://github.com/tpolvinen/Agri)

This blog is all about communicating the writing process of the said thesis. I will cover some of the most interesting and relevant research I've found and interviews of as diverse set of agents as I can get my grubby mitts on working on the field.
